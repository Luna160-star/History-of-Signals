        -One of the first form of communication (wireless even) was through communication signals used by
        differnt kingdoms and tribal people.
        <br>
        -The signals could be any specific sound or smoke signals sent sensing any danger or activity, as in, 
         a single drum beat could mean danger while two meant safe etc.
        <br>
        -For example: 
        In many kingdoms, towers were place away from the kingdoms with few guards on it, upon sensing 
        some danger, they would throw smoke signals or beat loud drums to alert the kingdom about upcoming
        danger.
