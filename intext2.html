            As empires grew, so did the technique of communication, people started writing on different objects such 
            as paper, barks of trees, stones and exchanging them to communicate.
            <br>
            Letters between royal kindgoms were exchanged through pigeons (in later times), on foor or horseback.
            <br>
            Letters contained about wars, alliance and love through different kindgoms.
